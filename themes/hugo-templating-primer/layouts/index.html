  <div>
    <ol class="content">
      <li class="title is-5 list-item">
        Go has its own templating language: https://pkg.go.dev/text/template
      </li>
      <li class="title is-5">
        Go templating is not particularly easy to lear or read. The fundamentals
        are easy to learn, but beyond the basics it’s a painful.
      </li>
      <li class="title is-5">
        There are superior JavaScript-based options for creating UI’s (e.g.
        React, Vue, Handlebars, etc.)
      </li>
      <li class="title is-5">
        The one context where Go templating shines above the rest is via Hugo -
        a static site generator written in Go.
      </li>
      <li class="title is-5">
        Hugo is by far the fastest static-site generator available today. And
        it’s orders of magnitude faster than more popular React-based options
        like Next.js and Gatsby.
      </li>
      <li class="title is-5">
        Hugo setup is dead simple, it comes with a variety of features and
        configuration for advanced customization.
      </li>
      <li class="title is-5">
        If you want to avoid all the fancy stuff, there are hundreds of free
        ready-to-go themes you can drop in and use.
      </li>
      <li class="title is-5">
        If we're going to build a bunch of Go apps that need documentation. We
        should consider Go Templating + Hugo + CSS Framework.
      </li>
      <li class="title is-5">
        The only obstacle is learning Go templating, which is a low barrier to
        entry.
      </li>
      <li class="title is-5">
        There CMS options for non-developers create, edit, and maintain content.
